# ðŸ’ª This exercise is HARD

# Take a look inside file1.txt and file2.txt. They each contain a bunch of numbers, each number on a new line.

# You are going to create a list called result which contains the numbers that are common in both files.

with open("file1.txt") as file1:
    file_1_data = file1.readlines()

with open("file2.txt") as file2:
    file_2_data = file2.readlines()

result = [int(num) for num in file_1_data if num in file_2_data]

# Write your code above ðŸ‘†

print(result)
